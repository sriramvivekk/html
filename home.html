        <p>The 2018 EFL League Two play-off final was an association football match played on 28 May 2018 at Wembley Stadium (pictured), London, between Coventry City F.C. and Exeter City F.C. The match determined the fourth and final team to gain promotion from EFL League Two, English football's fourth tier, to EFL League One; the top three teams of the 2017–18 EFL League Two season were automatically promoted to the 2018–19 EFL League One. Teams placed from fourth to seventh in the table took part in play-off semi-finals, with the winners of these semi-finals competing for the final place. Coventry won the match 3–1. Coventry opened the scoring through Jordan Willis, followed by two more goals from Jordan Shipley and Jack Grimmer. Exeter had a consolation goal in the last minutes of the match, thanks to a curled strike from Kyle Edwards. Coventry earned their first promotion since 1967, with Marc McNulty, their striker, being named the man of the match. (Full article...)</p>
